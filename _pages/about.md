I am currently a final-year PhD student from [Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics](https://www.monash.edu/business/ebs), [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu). I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Catherine Forbes](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/catherine-forbes) and [A/P Dan Zhu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/dan-zhu). My research interests lie primarily in two areas: **actuarial science**, with a focus on mortality modeling and longevity risk management; and **Bayesian econometrics**, particularly Bayesian time series analysis and Bayesian nonparametric methods. 

_All models are wrong, but some are useful._
