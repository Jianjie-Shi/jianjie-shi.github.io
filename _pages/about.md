I am currently a final-year PhD student in the [Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics](https://www.monash.edu/business/ebs) at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu). I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Catherine Forbes](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/catherine-forbes) and [A/P Dan Zhu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/dan-zhu). My PhD thesis is _Bayesian Time Series Modelling of Mortality Data_.

I graduated with [Master of Statistics](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2017/program/mstat) (with Commendation) in the [Research School of Finance, Actuarial Studies & Statistics](https://rsfas.anu.edu.au) at [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au) in December 2018. I have been awarded a [University Medal](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/prizes/university-medal-and-postgraduate-medal-for-academic-excellence) in 2018. My Master thesis is _Time-varying factor model_ supervised by [A/P Yanrong Yang](https://cbe.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/associate-professor-yanrong-yang) and [Dr Fei Huang](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/fei-huang).

I have received dual degrees from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/): [Bachelor of Management in Financial Management](https://bus.sysu.edu.cn/en) in June 2015 and [Bachelor of Science in Statistics](https://math.sysu.edu.cn) in June 2016.

My research interests lie primarily in two areas: 
1. **Actuarial Science**, with a focus on mortality modeling and longevity risk management;
2. **Bayesian Econometrics**, particularly Bayesian time series analysis and Bayesian nonparametric methods.
